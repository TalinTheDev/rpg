# RPG

## Intro
I have no clue what I am doing.

But, in my continuous attempt to learn game development, Zig, Raylib, and all
sorts of other things, I am making yet another game. 

I say yet another as if I have many games. I don't. Just a very simple Pong.
Emphasis on the simple.

You know what I mean though. Anyways, so I have decided to make a RPG or a
Role-Playing-Game. I have no experience with this genre because I have no
experience with game development and I'm not an avid gamer either. But one can
have dreams. 

The game currently has no title, it's just called **RPG** which I suppose is a
fitting name. I will definitely come up with a better name soon though. Trust.

## Features
So what I have in terms of features so far are:

**Dev**:
- Zig w/ Raylib Bindings
- Dev Container Setup

**Game**:
- A sky blue colored window
- Player sprite from [kenney.nl](https://kenney.itch.io/creature-mixer)
- Player moves and also flips on horizontal movement
- Camera follows player + orange circle at origin for reference
- Player has an idle and a walking/running animation

Planned features (for next update/very distant future) are:

**Dev**:
- Learn how to test and what you can test in a game

**Game**:
- A tilemap that can be rendered into a nice environment
- Diagonal movement shouldn't be faster
